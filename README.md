# AI Agent from Scratch  

This project is a lightweight **AI research agent** built from scratch with **OpenAI API** and **LangChain**.  
It integrates external knowledge sources like **DuckDuckGo** and **Wikipedia**, and extends them with my own **custom tools** â€” including a text-saving utility that automatically writes research outputs to a `.txt` file.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how an agent can:  
- Take a user query  
- Decide which tools to call  
- Collect and summarize information  
- Persist the results for later use
