{"topic": "Georgian elections", "summary": "Georgia operates a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. The President is the ceremonial head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government. In 2019–2020, debates over the electoral system culminated in reforms toward greater proportional representation. Under a March 2020 agreement between the ruling Georgian Dream and the opposition, the number of seats elected under the proportional system increased from 77 to 120 out of 150, creating a 120-proportional/30-majoritarian Parliament. The reforms aimed to broaden party-list representation ahead of elections. OSCE/ODIHR has repeatedly observed Georgian elections, publishing assessments of compliance with OSCE commitments and recommendations for improvements; most notably, the OSCE/ODIHR observed the 2021 local elections and issued a final report. For background on the political system and electoral framework, see the Elections in Georgia and Constitution of Georgia (electoral provisions).", "sources": ["Elections in Georgia - Wikipedia", "Constitution of Georgia - electoral system", "OSCE/ODIHR Election Assessment Georgia 2021-2022", "OSCE/ODIHR Georgia local elections 2021 final report", "Georgia 8 March 2020 electoral reform agreement (Georgian Dream–opposition)"], "tools_used": ["functions.search", "functions.wikipedia", "functions.save_text_to_file"]}
